## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for the projects I developed during my internship at Zidio Development. This collection showcases the diverse range of tasks I worked on, focusing on enhancing my skills in data science and analytics.

## Projects Overview

### Project One: Emotion Recognition from Speech

**Abstract:**

This project aims to recognize emotions from speech using the Toronto Emotional Speech Set (TESS) dataset. The goal is to classify audio samples into different emotional categories using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models.

**Introduction:**

Emotion recognition is an important aspect of human-computer interaction and can be applied in various fields, such as sentiment analysis, human behavior analysis, and assistive technologies. This project explores the use of deep learning models to classify emotions based on audio signals.

**Problem Statement:**

The TESS dataset contains audio recordings of actors reading neutral statements in various emotional tones. The objective is to build a model that can accurately classify these recordings into different emotions, such as happy, sad, angry, fearful, disgusted, and surprised.

**Objectives:**

1. Load and preprocess the TESS dataset.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis and visualize audio data.
3. Extract features using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs).
4. Train and evaluate LSTM models for emotion classification.
5. Analyze model performance and provide insights.

**Methodology:**

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
  - Load audio files from the TESS dataset.
  - Preprocess audio signals for feature extraction.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
  - Visualize audio waveforms and spectrograms.
  - Analyze the distribution of emotions in the dataset.

- **Feature Extraction:**
  - Extract MFCC features from audio signals.

- **Model Training:**
  - Train LSTM models using the extracted features.
  - Evaluate model performance using accuracy and loss metrics.

- **Results and Insights:**
  - Analyze model performance and interpret results.
  - Provide insights into emotion recognition from speech.

**Future Improvements:**

- Incorporating additional audio features for improved accuracy.
- Exploring different deep learning architectures for better performance.
- Implementing real-time emotion recognition in applications.

### Project Two: E-commerce Customer Segmentation

**Abstract:**

This project involves performing customer segmentation for an e-commerce platform to better understand customer behavior and preferences. By identifying distinct groups of customers, the company can tailor its marketing strategies to improve customer engagement and increase sales.

**Introduction:**

Customer segmentation is crucial for businesses to identify and target specific customer groups effectively. This project aims to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and interactions with the platform.

**Problem Statement:**

The dataset contains information about customers, their demographics, purchase history, and interactions with the e-commerce platform. The objective is to segment customers into distinct groups based on these features.

**Objectives:**

1. Perform exploratory data analysis to understand customer behavior.
2. Clean and preprocess the dataset for clustering.
3. Apply K-Means clustering to identify customer segments.
4. Analyze the characteristics of each segment and provide insights.

**Methodology:**

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
  - Handle missing values and duplicates.
  - Normalize numerical features for clustering.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
  - Analyze customer demographics and purchase patterns.
  - Visualize customer interactions with the platform.

- **Clustering Analysis:**
  - Apply the K-Means algorithm for customer segmentation.
  - Determine the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method and silhouette analysis.

- **Cluster Analysis:**
  - Analyze the characteristics of each cluster.
  - Provide insights into customer behavior and preferences.

**Summary of Clusters:**

- **Cluster 0:** Primarily composed of customers with [summary of findings].
- **Cluster 1:** Characterized by [summary of findings].
- **Cluster 2:** Comprises customers who [summary of findings].

**Future Improvements:**

- Incorporating additional features such as customer feedback and reviews.
- Exploring different clustering algorithms for better insights.
- Implementing real-time customer segmentation for dynamic targeting.
