Introduction
Welcome to the repository for the projects I developed during my internship at Zidio Development. This collection showcases the diverse range of tasks I worked on, focusing on enhancing my skills in machine learning, data analysis, and analytics.

Projects Overview
Project One: Emotion Recognition from Speech
Abstract:

This project aims to recognize emotions from speech using the Toronto Emotional Speech Set (TESS) dataset. The goal is to classify audio samples into different emotional categories using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models.

Introduction:

Emotion recognition is an important aspect of human-computer interaction and can be used in various applications, such as sentiment analysis, human behavior analysis, and assistive technologies. This project explores the use of deep learning models to classify emotions based on audio signals.

Problem Statement:

The TESS dataset contains audio recordings of actors reading neutral statements in various emotional tones. The objective is to build a model that can accurately classify these recordings into different emotions, such as happy, sad, angry, fearful, disgusted, and surprised.

Objectives:

Load and preprocess the TESS dataset.
Perform exploratory data analysis and visualize audio data.
Extract features using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs).
Train and evaluate LSTM models for emotion classification.
Analyze model performance and provide insights.
Methodology:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:
Load audio files from the TESS dataset.
Normalize and preprocess audio signals.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualize waveforms and spectrograms of audio samples.
Feature Extraction:
Use MFCCs to extract relevant features from audio signals.
Model Training:
Train LSTM models for emotion classification.
Evaluate model performance using accuracy and other metrics.
Results and Analysis:
Provide insights into model performance and potential improvements.
Project Two: E-commerce Customer Segmentation
Technologies:

Data Science
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Seaborn
Matplotlib
Yellowbrick
Domain: E-commerce

Project Overview:

The project aims to perform customer segmentation for an e-commerce platform to better understand customer behavior and preferences. By identifying distinct groups of customers, the company can tailor its marketing strategies to improve customer engagement and increase sales.

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):

Extract: The dataset is extracted from the e-commerce platform, containing various attributes such as customer ID, gender, order history, and search behavior.

Transform: Data cleaning and transformation involve handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling numerical features.

Load: The transformed data is loaded into a dataframe for further analysis and clustering.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Gender Distribution: Analyze the gender distribution among customers.

Order Analysis: Investigate order patterns and behavior across different segments.

Brand Preferences: Understand brand preferences based on search behavior.

Clustering Analysis:

Feature Scaling: Normalize features using MinMaxScaler.

Optimal Cluster Determination:

Use the elbow method and silhouette analysis to identify the optimal number of clusters.
K-Means Clustering: Implement K-Means clustering to segment customers into distinct groups.

Cluster Analysis: Analyze the characteristics and behaviors of each cluster to provide actionable insights.

Summary of Clusters:

Cluster 0: [Summary of findings for Cluster 0].

Cluster 1: [Summary of findings for Cluster 1].

Cluster 2: [Summary of findings for Cluster 2].

Future Improvements:

Incorporating Additional Features: Including more demographic and transactional data could enhance cluster accuracy.

Exploring Different Clustering Algorithms: Trying algorithms like hierarchical clustering or DBSCAN may yield different insights.

Real-Time Clustering: Implementing a real-time clustering system to dynamically segment customers as new data becomes available.
